This is Srinivas Yedhuri. I'm a front end engineer at Citrix R&D working on the Netscaler and associated products UI Team.
Formely worked at Yahoo! I have been working on the web since 2005.

This blog is a place where I write about web technologies, Productivity tools, Workflows etc.

Opinions are of my own and have nothing to do with the companies I worked for or working for.
